# EDDIE JAOUDE COMMUNITY PROJECTS
Our projects are open to all contributors, to get started with contributing to our projects, you can check out our projects [here](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity), and choose a project you wish to make contributions to.

# HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE TO A PROJECT?
- If this is your first contribution, see [NEWCOMERS.md](NEWCOMERS.md). You might also want to take up issues with the [good first issue](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieJaoudeCommunity.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieJaoudeCommunity.github.io/labels/help%20wanted) label.

- Discuss the changes you wish to make by creating an [issue](https://github.com/EddieJaoudeCommunity/EddieJaoudeCommunity.github.io/issues/new) or comment on an already created issue, or contact us via our [discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jZQs6Wu). 
- Once, you have been assigned the issue by the maintainer, you can go ahead to fork the repo, clone and make changes to fix the issue. For steps on how to do this, this [here](NEWCOMERS.md) is a helpful guide.

# MAKING YOUR PULL REQUEST
When you are done with your changes, and you have checked the new changes you made, you can now create a pull request referencing the number of the issue you fixed in the description as seen here:
```
This PR fixes issue # "issue number"
```

Once, you have completed this, your pull request would be reviewed by a maintainer, if it satisfies the requirements of the corresponding issue to which it was made, it would be merged.

Kudos to you :ballons:
